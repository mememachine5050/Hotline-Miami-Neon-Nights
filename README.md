game haha YESSIRRRRR


you can use any assets i release in your own projects. but you CANNOT use them for your own financial gain! as in if its in a game you *CANNOT* use them if its paid in any way.
if its available for free that is perfectly fine, i'd like you to credit me but its fine if you dont. just dont claim that you drew it yk.
